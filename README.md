INTRODUCTION
Title: Overbooked Club
Project by: Beulah Mathenge
Github pages link: https://beulah-matt.github.io/overbooked-club-project/
Short Description: The OverBooked project is my take at creating a simple web application where avid readers can keep track of their favourite books, updating them as new ones come up. Take it as a log of the books that are most impactful to a given reader.
 
THE IDEA
Sometimes you want to give book recommendations to your friends but cannot quite remember what they are.
By having a book log, you will easily have a quick reference to what made your mind tick.
 
THE PROCESS.
I have used HTML/CSS and JS to build my web app. Most of the functionality has been built with JavaScript, interacting with the DOM.
I have listeners for DOM Content Loading, programmatically giving instructions on when and how my code will run. This has been archived with Asynchronous functions as well, majorly to fetch data.
Structure and style are mostly on HTML and CSS, serving as a blueprint of what my page should look like.
My data is stored on a local JSON file, as such the github pages view will be different from the view on a local hosted page.
 
USER INTERACTION
I have added interactivity by allowing users to key in their favourite books and have them appear on the page once they hit the add button on the book submission form.
Once a book is rendered, a user can also like it -using a heart emoji- my thought on this being there are books that will be more important to a reader and can be marked as so. For now, the like is not persistent but just a way of improving the user experience.
I have provisions for both dark and light reading modes, and one can switch between either by clicking on a button.
A user can also delete the books from the listed books by clicking on delete.
